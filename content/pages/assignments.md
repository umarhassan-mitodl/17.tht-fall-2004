_Reviewing Past Theses_

A. We will read two past award-winning theses, selected by relevance to current student topics

B. Sharpening the Topic, Developing Theory

Note: For the next three weeks, we will be discussing methodological choices. During this time, you are expected to be ready to discuss the assigned readings. You should also be reading on your topics and developing a bibliography and knowledge of existing research.

Literature Review


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Write a review of the literature relevant to both of your topics from the first assignment. Find at least a dozen references-books, book chapters, and journal articles-**on both topics**. Skim them quickly. Then write two papers, one on each topic, two pages in length.

\- Provide the basic bibliographic information for each citation.

\- For each citation provide a short paragraph on the research question and the findings.

\- Summarize the literature development in each of your topics, ending with an assessment of the major puzzles or questions that remain to be explored.

Class Presentations of Existing Research


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Find one example of research related to one of the topics you identified for the session 2 class. This can either be a book or an article. Write a two-page paper in which you discuss the research method and findings of the study. This paper should do the following:

\- Describe the research focus of the study, why it is significant, its general method and most important findings.

\- Identify the principal dependent variable and independent variables involved in the study and describe how they were measured.

\- Assess the findings. Did the study, on its own terms, succeed?
